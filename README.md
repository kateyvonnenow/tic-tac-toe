## :pencil2: Planning & problem Solving

- Set up a 3 x 3 grid as a playing field.
- Player 1 will be X
- Player 2 will be O
- Ensure that after Player 1’s turn, it will be Player 2’s turn and after Player 2’s turn, it will be Player 1’s turn. (.toggle??)
- No skips
- Ensure each grid square can only be “taken” once in a game and can not be “taken over” by the opponent player on their turn.
- Ensure that whoever is the first player to “take over” 3 grid squares in a vertical/horizontal/diagonal row is the winner of the game.
- When none of the players “take over” 3 grids in a row, the game should be a draw.
- Provide the option to play again once a games is won or drawn.
