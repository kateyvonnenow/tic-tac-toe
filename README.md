## :book: About + How to Play

Just a basic 2 player Tic Tac Toe Game - but with a dash of pink! 
Upon opening the game, both players will be asked as to how they would like to be addressed throughout the game. Each player shall enter a name of their choosing (or not), and when ready to play - click the 'ready' button!

:cake: FEATURES: :cake:
- Win count
- Varying Background themes (Just click on the Tic Tac Toe title to change backgrounds)
- Music (if not playing on google chrome)

## :pencil2: Planning & problem Solving

- Set up a 3 x 3 grid as a playing field.
- Player 1 will be X
- Player 2 will be O
- Ensure that after Player 1’s turn, it will be Player 2’s turn and after Player 2’s turn, it will be Player 1’s turn. (.toggle??)
- No skips
- Ensure each grid square can only be “taken” once in a game and can not be “taken over” by the opponent player on their turn.
- Ensure that whoever is the first player to “take over” 3 grid squares in a vertical/horizontal/diagonal row is the winner of the game.
- When none of the players “take over” 3 grids in a row, the game should be a draw.
- Provide the option to play again once a games is won or drawn.

## :rocket: Cool tech

- JavaScript + HTML + CSS

- ~~Replay button toggling its opacity on/off upon clicking on tile~~
- ~~Replay button showing below the background~~
- Music may not play :(

## :sob: Lessons learnt

What I would do differently if I could wind back the clock...

I would make it better.
